4 GPUs with 8 cores in each
1.pair of rectified images obtained
2.Harris corner detection:can be done in parallel in opencv.:
	average of the gradient matrix over a window:can be done in parallel--get corner strength and select points which lie above a certain threshold.
3.correlation computation;brightness reduction;averaging filter---distribute the job over the various feature points obtained in step 2.
4.RANSAC robust estimation:random sampling done in parallel
5.disparity element growing:NCC over 4 neighbourhoods--each can be done in parallel for 8 seed points
